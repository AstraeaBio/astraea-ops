# astraea-ops
Central Repository for All Astraea Operational Tasks

This lives or dies based on **rules**, not vibes.

## New rules for the Astraea Bio team:

1. **If you troubleshoot something non-trivial, you update the KB.**
   - No exception.
2. **No ticket is “Done” until:**
   - Logs attached
   - Root cause identified (even if partial)
   - KB entry created or updated.
3. **Every week in team sync:**
   - We will review: “What did we add to the KB this week?”
   - If the answer is “nothing”, that means:
     - Either nothing broke (unlikely), or
     - People aren’t documenting (much more likely) → lets make sure we are contributing and updating as needed.
